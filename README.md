# NUCLS-Image-Segmentation
Employs a multi-class Mask R-CNN model to detect cells within images of biopsies provided by the NUCLS dataset.

NUCLS dataset: https://sites.google.com/view/nucls/home

Attached are images of the input training images and the output from the model
The input images are taken from biopsies of patients with breast cancer and show each individual cell mapped out and labeled
The output image shows the model's predicted bounds for each cell along with the accuracy for each segementation at the top left
